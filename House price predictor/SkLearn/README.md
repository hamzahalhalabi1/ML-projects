# Project Title: Housing Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze housing data using various attributes such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity. The data will be used to gain insights into the housing market and make informed decisions.

## Data Description
1. **Longitude**: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west.
2. **Latitude**: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north.
3. **Housing Median Age**: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number indicates a newer building.
4. **Total Rooms**: Total number of rooms within a block.
5. **Total Bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms within a block.
6. **Population**: Total number of people residing within a block.
7. **Households**: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block.
8. **Median Income**: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars).
9. **Median House Value**: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars).
10. **Ocean Proximity**: Location of the house with respect to the ocean/sea.

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the housing dataset containing the above-mentioned attributes. This dataset can be obtained from various sources such as government databases, research institutions, or online repositories.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers if any. Convert categorical variables, such as ocean proximity, into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of each attribute, identify correlations between variables, and visualize trends using graphs and charts.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary, such as calculating rooms per household or bedrooms per room, to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests, depending on the problem statement. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess how well it predicts median house values.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data or integrate it into applications for real-time predictions.
